SQL AGENT USING LANGCHAIN
------------------------
This project demonstrates a SQL Agent built using LangChain.
The agent allows users to ask questions in natural language and
automatically converts them into SQL queries.
It executes the queries on a database and returns clear results.
This helps non-technical users interact with databases easily.
